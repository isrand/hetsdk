# Integration tests

This folder contains, temporarily, a suite of tests that test the integration with the Hedera Network. In the future it will be replaced by a "flows" folder that will test specific scenarios such as

* Create topic with 2 participants, send messages and ensure they both can read them
* Create topic with 2 participants, send messages, add a third one with forward secrecy and ensure they can't see previous messages
* etc...
